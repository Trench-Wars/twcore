/**
 * Spec module for TWBot.
 *
 * This module allows the user 4 methods of speccing:
 * 1) speccing everyone
 * 2) speccing specific freqs
 * 3) speccing specific ships
 * 4) speccing specific people
 *
 * The syntax for the spec module is as follows:
 *
 * You are allowed to add multiple spec tasks to the bot.  It will keep track of
 * player deaths and spec players if they get too many losses.  If there are
 * multiple ways a player could be specced, the following order of precedance
 * will be used:
 *
 * 1) !SpecPlayer
 * 2) !SpecShip
 * 3) !SpecFreq
 * 4) !Spec
 *
 * Where 1 is the highest precedance and 4 is the lowest.  For example:
 * !Spec 5 will spec him at 5 deaths, however if you do !SpecFreq 0 10, all
 * players on freq 0 will be specced at 10 deaths because !SpecFreq is ranked
 * higher than !Spec.
 *
 * Another new Feature is the ability to !AddDeath <PlayerName>.  If the player
 * is being currently watched for deaths, this command will give a them one
 * extra life.  !AddDeath does the following:
 *
 * !Spec 10 - specs everyone at 10 deaths.
 * !AddDeath <PlayerName> - Will add 1 death to PlayerName by making a new Spec
 * Task of the player at 11 deaths.
 *
 * Here is the help menu:
 * !Spec <Deaths>                                 -- Specs everyone at <Deaths> deaths.",
 * !SpecFreq <Freq>:<Deaths>                      -- Specs freq <Freq> at <Deaths> deaths.",
 * !SpecShip <Ship>:<Deaths>                      -- Specs ship <Ship> at <Deaths> deaths.",
 * !SpecPlayer <Player>:<Deaths>                  -- Specs player <Player> at <Deaths> deaths.",
 * !AddDeath <Player>                             -- Specs player <Player> at one more death.",
 * !SpecShared <Deaths>                           -- Specs everyone on a freq at COMBINED <Deaths>.",
 * !SpecList                                      -- Shows a list of spec tasks.",
 * !SpecDel <Task Number>                         -- Removes spec task number <Task Number>.",
 * !SpecOff                                       -- Stops watching deaths."
 *
 * NOTE: The !spec command is removed from the standard module so please !load
 * spec first before trying to do !spec :P
