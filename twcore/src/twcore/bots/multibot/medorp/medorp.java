//medorP bot, written by Lain
//
/*NOTES
//The last bug I can identify.....
//Fix the !start x_deaths thing, so it announces to the host if the
//paramater is invalid instead of starting anyway with default 2 deaths.
/*		08-08-07
 * Arena locking issue tackled. Because of the toggle, if the game is killed before
 * the lock, it will still issue another lock
 * (instead of the proper unlock like it would if it were killed mid-game).
 *
 * Changed streak texts to read from an array (easier to change them)
 *
 * Ship change function is now sleeker and more efficient (no more CASE:, its a quick IF)
 *
 * Streak function is now a FOR loop instead of lots of IF's.
 * Same function (and excecution speed), its just condensed for easy reading (and debugging...
 * because it was crashing the bot)
