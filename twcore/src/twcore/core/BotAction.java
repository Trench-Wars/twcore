/**
 * The main bot utility class, your bot's best and easiest method of performing
 * actions in the arena, getting information on players, scheduling tasks to be
 * performed, and much more.  Being familiar with the features of BotAction will
 * allow you to do just about anything you require.  Every bot has a reference
 * to BotAction available as m_botAction, thanks to the bot superclass, SubspaceBot.
 * <p>
 * <u>Some of BotAction's abilities include:</u><br>
 *  - Sending public, private, arena, zone and warning messages.<br>
 *  - Setting ships, freqs, locking/unlocking arenas, spec'ing, warping, and setting doors.<br>
 *  - Scheduling tasks to run at a future time, or run repeatedly.<br>
 *  - Creating teams by team size or number of teams, and setshipping or warping all on a freq.<br>
 *  - Controlling the bot as a playing ship, changing arenas, and getting an arena list.<br>
 *  - Setting how reliable position data for players is (important!).<br>
 *  - Showing and hiding LVZ objects from one or all players using the Objset class to keep track.<br>
 *  - Accessing SQL databases simply and effectively.<br>
 *  - Sending messages between bots.<br>
 *  - Getting data about players, flags, the bot itself, CFG files, player iterators, and more.<br>
 * <p>
 * Note that this is just SOME of what BotAction can do; it can do much, much more!
 * <p>
 * If you are currently viewing the JavaDoc, and wish to see a more logical and in-depth
 * organization of all BotAction has to offer, <b><u>look at the BotAction source</b></u>.

 * BotAction Method Directory  (search source by number and title)
 * <p>
 * 1. TASK SCHEDULING - scheduling events w/ TimerTasks to run at a later time
 * 2. MESSAGING - sending single and multi-line messages of all kinds
 * 3. MISC OPERATIONS - everything else: setting ships & freqs, changing arenas,
 * SQL DB ops, inter-process communications, etc.
 * 4. GETTERS - getting accessible data, usually from instances of other classes

     * Task scheduling is not difficult in TWCore.  It allows you to create events
     * that will run at a later time, or run repeatedly at regular intervals.
     *
     * To schedule a task, create a new internal class for your bot that extends the
     * TimerTask class, and include a run() method in the class containing the code
     * you want to run when the TimerTask executes.  Then call either scheduleTask
     * (for running once) or scheduleTaskAtFixedRate (for running repeatedly) to
     * schedule the task, and you're done.
     *
     * If you ever need to cancel the task, hold a reference to it and call the cancel
     * method.  Make sure your tasks finish an execution as quickly as possible so as to
     * avoid delaying other task from running.

    /*
     * Messages generally consist of three components: a way to identify the target,
     * which is either the player ID or name; the message itself; and optionally, a
     * sound code to play along with the message.
     *
     * Messages come in several different types: public, private, team-wide, arena-wide,
     * zone-wide, to an opposing team, on a chat, or as a public macro.
     *
     * Private messages also come in two flavors.  A normal private message is to
     * someone in the arena (/), whereas a remote is to anywhere on the billing
     * server, and requires the server to look up their location in order to deliver
     * it.  Therefore, normal private messages cause less server load, but also
     * will not be received if the player is outside the arena.  Use Smart private
     * messages if you're unsure of where the player is, and want to guarantee that
     * they receive the message.  TWCore will try to find the person in the arena,
     * and if they can't be found, will send it remotely.
     *
     * Use private message spams to send many messages at once to a player, such as
     * for a help display.

     *  - ARENA OPERATIONS: Lock/unlock arena, reset flag game, set timer, set doors,
     *    toggle public & private chat on/off, set power of thors in arena.
     *  - COMPLEX OPERATIONS: Team creation by team size or # teams, mass warping,
     *    mass shipsetting, mass setfreq'ing, old spec@death method, arena data clear.
     *  - BOT OPERATIONS: Join & change arenas, move ship, spectate on players, pick up
     *    and drop flags, set a banner, force an in-game death, force complete bot
     *    termination (logoff), force receiving of all death packets, get list of arenas,
     *    add spam protection, increase or decrease reliability of player position data,
     *    adjust rate of packets being sent, send and receive files to server.
     *  - LVZ OBJECT OPERATIONS: Show & hide one LVZ obj, show or hide a set of objs,
     *    and show & hide a set of objects based on objects managed by Objset.
     *  - SQL DATABASE OPERATIONS: Run regular, background and high-priority background
     *    queries, and automatically-formed table insertions for new records.
     *  - INTER-PROCESS COMMUNICATIONS: (For sending messages between bots -- very easy).
     *    Send a standard IPC message, transmit a generic object, subscribe bot to an
     *    IPC channel, unsubscribe from an IPC channel, and destroy an IPC channel.

     *  - SIMPLE GETTERS: Get bot name, ID #, current arena name, number of players
     *    in current arena, server address, server port, current state, & SQL status.
     *  - SIMPLE CLASS GETTERS: Gets for the following classes - BotAction, CoreData,
     *    OperatorList, EventRequester, BotSettings (for the general setup.cfg and
     *    for specific bots), Ship, InterProcessCommunicator, and Objset.
     *  - PLAYER/FLAG GETTERS: Get player by ID or name, get player ID, get player by
     *    fuzzy (incomplete) name, get player name by fuzzy name, get flag by flag ID.
     *  - COMPLEX GETTERS: Get number of players in the arena playing, if a frequency
     *    has a particular ship currently on it, total combined scores of all players
     *    on a freq, File corresponding to setup.cfg, File to file in /data directory,
     *    File to TWCore root directory, and File to file in TWCore root directory.
     *  - ITERATORS: Iterators over - all players currently in a ship in the arena,
     *    all players on a frequency, all players (spec'd and playing), all players
     *    by ID rather than Player objects, and all flags by ID.
