/**
 * The essential class holding information on a single Subspace player.  It contains
 * information gathered from various events/packets, with all that is considered
 * relevant or useful being stored here.
 * <p>
 * A <b>VERY IMPORTANT<b> consideration is that a player's X & Y location, X & Y velocities, rotation
 * amount, weapons and accessories data (XRadar, shields, etc) may not be accurate / updated.
 * Use BotAction's setPlayerPositionUpdating() to make this information more reliable.
 * <p>
 * Also note that <b>using the player's name is not a reliable method of identification</b>.
 * Only 19 of a possible 23 characters are stored; two players whose first 19 characters
 * of the name are identical can not be separated by the bot except by their player ID.
 * This brings the <i>additional<i> problem of player ID being represented in a single byte,
 * or 256 possible values, with ID re-use being possible -- this means that ID is also not
 * a reliable method of identification; it is useless if the player is not in the arena, and
 * it is not static in any sense.
