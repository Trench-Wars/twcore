 * The death green is the ID of the green that is left by this players death.
 * The bounty, along with the other kill score modifiers in settings are added
 * to the players kill points. The flags are how many flags were transferred
 * as a result of the kill.
 * 
 * NOTE: When getting IDs of the killer or victim, they very occasionally may
 * not match to an ID stored in Arena.  This is because one of the players may
 * leave the arena or zone only a moment after the death event is fired, clearing
 * their information from the Arena object, while still leaving what appears to be
 * a valid ID in the PlayerDeath event.  It's therefore extremely important to
 * check for a null value when attempting to reference by ID anything related to
 * the Player object stored in Arena.  (This includes any getPlayer, getPlayerName,
 * etc. checks from BotAction.)
