&What &TWL|TWL stands for Trench Wars Leagues. It has three divisions: Javelin (TWLJ), Dueling (TWLD), and Basing (TWLB). Javelin and Dueling play matches of 5 players per team, while basing features 8 players per team. Months before the league starts, squads compete in duels for ranking. In order to qualify for TWL, a squad must play 15 games in one division. The exact number of squads that are invited to participate depends on the amount of competition and demand in a specific division. If a squad drops out of the league, then the next highest ranking squad is invited to play. The TWL season is a very competitive time for most squads. It brings the most skilled players to the same arena in order to battle it out for victory and gain the esteem from all players as "the best." It is the highlight of Trench Wars and its reputation and prestige can not be compared to any other zone in Continuum.

&Aqua &Who|The sky was dark, the moon was high. All alone just her and I. Her hair so soft, her eyes so blue. I knew just what she wanted to do. Her skin so soft, her legs so fine. I ran my fingers down her spine. I didn't know how, but I tried my best, to place my hand on her breast. I remember my fear, my fast beating heart, but slowly she spread her legs apart. And when she did I felt no shame, as all at once the white stuff came. At last it was finished, it's all over now, my first time... milking a cow.
