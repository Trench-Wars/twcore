Release 1.2

	- fixed bug where application would become unresponsive if the internet connection

	  received, the icon changes color and the application flashes in the taskbar
	- the zone selection is now maintained after receiving updates from the directory server

	- added ?ignore command - use ?ignore add <name> and ?ignore remove <name> to add and
	  remove players from the ignore list
