Battleship Bot v3.0

*****Info*****
Made for ?go battleship in Trench
Features:
 - Regulates attaching of ships
 - Hosts battleship games
 - Manipulates LVZ to simulate day/night (night mode) 
 
*****New in this Release*****
This new version brings about a lot of improvements to the game as far as
simplicity of hosting and flexibility. The game can now be run on any of
the 5 boards in the ?go battleship arena for up to 4 teams with any 
combination of ships. Using *lock is no longer required for the game because
the bot will recognize any player who enters, leaves, or changes ships.
The command interface has been streamlined by having "game settings" that
determine certain things like how many teams will play, what board to use
and whether to lock people from changing into a capital ship. The game can
be started after custom picking teams, or randomness can be used with the
!assign command. In game, players will periodically be notified of any 
attachable ships on their team.
 
*****Hosting*****
This game will run right off the bat if you tell it to !start, but you will
probably want to configure it a bit first. Use the !set command to pick a 
board, how many teams to play, and whether to lock switching into a capital
ship. If you wish to have teams picked, you can do so, or you can use !assign
to give people random team and ship assignments. Once you are satisfied, use
!start to begin the game. Whenever someone changes ship, leaves, or dies,
the ship count will be updated. If you wish the bot to do a manual check, use
the !scheck command. When a team is eliminated, they will be put into spectator
mode. If you wish to put them back in, its possible, but you must manually warp
them back. If at any time you wish to terminate the game, use !stop.
