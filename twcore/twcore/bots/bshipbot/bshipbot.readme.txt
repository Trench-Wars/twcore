Battleship Bot v2.5

*****Info*****
Made for ?go battleship in Trench
Features:
 - Regulates attaching of ships
 - Hosts battleship games
 - Manipulates LVZ to simulate day/night (night mode) 
 
*****Hosting*****
The first thing you need to do is make sure everyone who is playing is
in the arena. Then teams need to be set up. You can do this manually, 
or random with !teams <number of teams to make>. Once teams have been
established, place everyone in the proper ships using !setup. Again, 
if you want to change the ship numbers of people around you can do it
manually, but after you !setup. Make sure the number of capital ships
is the same. Once you are ready to begin, !start the game and sit back
watching as they are warped to the arena to duke it out. If anything 
happens where a capital ship leaves a team without dying, you can
subtract one from the remaining ships counter with !remove <frequency>
