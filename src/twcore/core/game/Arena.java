/**
    Arena is used to keep track of player information in the Arena a bot is in.
    It is also used to spectate players in order to receive their position packets,
    as like any other client, a TWCore bot only receives position packets from
    other players when they are close.
    <p>
    <u>NOTE ABOUT PLAYER IDS:</u><br>
    "Player ID" refers to the internal packet ID used by the SS protocol rather than
    the player's UserID found in ?userid.  IDs are assigned sequentially arena-wide
    rather than zone-wide.  Large position packets send 2 bytes for ID, and small
    position packets send only 1; on the offchance that more than 256 players are in
    the arena at the same time, the server will begin sending only large position
    packets to alleviate potential problems with the same lower byte in two IDs.<br>
    However, if a player leaves the arena, their ID is freed up to be used by another
    player.  This can cause confusion in bots attempting to remember players primarily
    by their ID -- and for the reason that only 19 of a possible 23 characters of a
    player's name is accessible (aside from using *info) name is also not reliable.
    A combination of the two may be used, or just fairly meticulous planning.<br>
    A last word: using Arena's getPlayer(ID) method is more reliable than getPlayer(name),
    for the reasons described above.  If you need to get a Player object, try to do
    so by player ID rather than name.  For utmost security also compare the name in
    the Player object with the expected one.
